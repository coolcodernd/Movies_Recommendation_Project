This is a movie recommendation project made with the help of pandas library.In this project you input a movie name for eg Star Wars (1977) and no. of recommendations you want and it will give you the output
In this project I have use dataset from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/ and used u.data and u.item file
I have used only pandas wich u can install by     pip install pandas
It can only take movie names that are part of dataset
